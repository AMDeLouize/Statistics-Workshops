## Now run this code to load the packages you just installed. You will need to do this everytime you use the package.

# I. Introduction to R Markdown 

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Unlike with a normal R script, you can save and print both the code and the output from the code. This is useful when doing statistics in R, since what you care about is the output. Review the website above, and refer back to it when you want to create an R-markdown document.

Below is a "chunk." It refers to a chunk of r code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. Insert a chunk below this line





When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). Preview this document now. 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents currently in the r markdown editor. It does not run any code chunks. To run and save the output of all of the code chunks use *Knit*. You can Knit a document to an html, Word, or PDF document by clicking the little arrow indicating the dropdown menu next to *Preview*. Practice kniting this document to word now (note: you might not be able to do a PDF because latex needs to be downloaded first), and make sure to do it again once we have completed the workshop so that you have all of the code and output in an organized, easy to read, format. 

# II. Importing Data and other First Steps

First, it is helpful to save the data you are working with to the project folder for the R analysis. Click File, New Project, then name and pick a location to save the directory. This will create a Project folder that this markdown document will be saved in. Then download the data from https://github.com/AMDeLouize/Statistics-Workshops/blob/master/Young%20People%20Survey_Basic%20Stats%20Workshop.xlsx and save it in the project folder you created.  

Now it's time to read in the data using R script. Click the green arrow in the upper right of the chunk, select the code and click run at the top of this document, or select the code and press Ctrl+Enter. Try it now (Note: if you do not have the read xl package downloaded and would like to download it delete the hashtag and run all 3 lines of code):  
```{r}
data <- read_xlsx('Young People Survey_Basic Stats Workshop.xlsx', col_names = TRUE, na = "")
```
Note that the name to the left is one you make up to store your data frame as an R object. It will show up under the "Environment" tab to the right now. You can double click the dataframe in the "Environment" tab to open a tab where you can view the data.  

Now look at the structure of the data to see the names of all the variables and what they are stored as:
```{r}
str(data)
```

Now would be a good time to look at the questionnaire the data came from to better understand what these variables represent. You can find the questionnare at https://github.com/AMDeLouize/Statistics-Workshops/blob/master/Questionnaire_BasicStatsSeries.docx 

Notice most of the variables are numeric "num," with a few character strings "chr". We want to turn the characters into factors to be able to analyze. In other words, we want r to know that "female" and "male" refer to groups of people. Here is the code to turn the Gender character variable into a factor variable:

```{r}
data$Gender <- as.factor(data$Gender)
```
To select only one variable in the dataset use the $ (e.g., dataname$variablename)

Now edit the above code to turn the variables Alcohol, Internetusage, Leftrighthanded, and Education into factor variables:

```{r}

```


# III. Hypotheses 

The following explain the different statistical tests and outlines the hypothesis we are going to test for each. Using the dataset, the questionnaire, and the example hypotheses, come up with a second hypothesis for the first four tests (Correlation, t-test, Chi-Squared test, One-way ANOVA, and Two-way ANOVA). 

### 1. Correlation
Are two continous variables related? (Need two numeric variables)

Hypothesis 1. People who enjoy music will also tend to enjoy movies.

Hypothesis 2. 

### 2. Independent T-test
Are two groups different on a continous variable? (Need a factor variable with two groups and a numeric variable)

Hypothesis 1. Women will enjoy romantic movies more than men.

Hypothesis 2. 

### 3. Chi-Squared Test
Are two groups different in their group membership? (Need two factor variables)

Hypothesis 1. Only children will be left-handed more than children with siblings.

Hypothesis 2.

### 4. One-Way ANOVA
Are three groups different on a continuous outcome variable? (Need a factor variable with 3+ groups and a numeric variable)

Hypothesis 1. People who drink a lot of alcohol will like pop music more than social drinkers, and social drinkers will like pop music more than non-drinkers.

Hypothesis 2. 

### 5. Two-way ANOVA
Does membership in different combonations of two grouyps change a continuous outcome variable? (Need two factor variables and numeric variable)

Hypothesis 1a. People who drink a lot of alcohol will spend more money on entertainment than social drinkers, and social drinkers will spend more on entertainment than non-drinkers.

Hypothesis 1b. Men will spend more money on entertainment than women.

Hypothesis 1c. Drinking in men will lead to bigger differences in entertainment spending than it will for women such that men who drink more will spend significantly more on entertainment than women.

### 6. Multiple Linear Regression 
Do continuous predictors and group memberships affect a continuous outcome variable? (Need numeric or factor predictors and numeric outcome)

Hypothesis 1. People who drink a lot and drink socially will save less money than people who do not drink alcohol when controlling for age, gender, the propensity to give to charity, the number of friends, and the propensity for regret.

# IV. Descriptive Statistics

### All Data

You can get summary statistics on the entire dataset. This is useful for QA/QC with data (making sure your variables represent what they should). Run the following code:

```{r}
summary(data)
```

BUT that doesn't give you information on your standard deviations. Try running the following code from the skimr package.
```{r}
skim(data)
```

### Specific Variables
You might want to call summary statistics for the entire dataset. To select only one variable in the dataset use the $ (e.g., dataname$variablename). Try it below:
```{r}
skim(data$Dance)
mean(data$Dance)
mean(data$Dance, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Important R Note:   
You can look at the R Documentation for a function using the ? and search the internet help pages for the term using ??.
```{r}
?skim
?mean
??standarddeviation
```

Use the last bit of code (??standarddeviation) to code for the standard deviation of dance using the stats::sd help page.
```{r}

```

### Group By
Sometimes you might not want the grand mean, but means for the groups that you are comparing. For example, our t-test hypothesis is "Women will enjoy romantic movies more than men" so we might want a mean romantic movie enjoyment rating for women and a mean romantic movie enjoyment rating for men. Here't the code to run summary statistics by groups:
```{r}
describe.by(data$Romantic, group = data$Gender)
```

In r there is always a ton of ways to do the same or similar things. Try this code for summarizing by group:
```{r}
# Remove NAs from group variable
genderdata <- filter(data, !is.na(Gender))

# Group by Gender
genderdata <- group_by(genderdata, Gender)

# Calculate group summary statistics 
summarize(genderdata, Mean = mean(Romantic, na.rm = T), StandardDeviation = sd(Romantic, na.rm = T), Minimum = min(Romantic, na.rm = T), Maximum = max(Romantic, na.rm = T), n = n())
```

Now get summary statistics by group for your t-test hypothesis (t-test hypothesis 2). Choose either of the two methods presented above (don't need to do both):
```{r}

```
